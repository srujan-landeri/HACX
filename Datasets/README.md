## Datasets

The training dataset used in this paper is CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 Data Set. These datasets are valuable resources for training and testing the Zero-day Attack Detection and Prevention System. They contain a diverse range of intrusion types and provide the foundation for our model's accuracy and effectiveness.

### Dataset Details

- **Intrusion Types**: The datasets encompass six different intrusion types, including Brute-force, Botnet, DoS, DDoS, Web attacks, and infiltration of the network from inside.

- **Specific Intrusions**: Within these categories, there are a total of 14 different intrusions, namely:
    - Botnet attack
    - FTP-BruteForce
    - SSH-BruteForce
    - BruteForce-Web
    - BruteForce-XSS
    - DDoS-HOIC attack
    - DDoS-LOIC-UDP attack
    - DDoS-LOIC-HTTP attack
    - Infiltration attack
    - DoS-Hulk attack
    - DoS-SlowHTTPTest attack
    - DoS-GoldenEye attack
    - DoS-Slowloris attack

- **Source**: These datasets were collected from kaggle created by Communications Security Establishment (CSE) & the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC).

- **Open Source**: The datasets have been made open source and are accessible for research and development purposes.

- **Benign Data**: In addition to attack data, benign data was collected for a week from a typical research network. This benign traffic includes routine daily activities such as emailing, searching, news, video streaming, etc.

- **Data Labeling**: All attacks and benign traffic are labeled, making them suitable for training and evaluating the performance of detection models.

- **Features**: The dataset comprises 80 bi-directional flow features, providing rich data for analysis and model training.
